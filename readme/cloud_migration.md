# Cloud Migration

1. **Application Hosting:** Deploy backend on container orchestration platforms such as Amazon EKS or Google Kubernetes Engine

2. **Advanced LLM Integration**: Utilize advanced versions of Large Language Models (LLMs), for instance, instead of Gemini-flash, use Gemini-advanced for
quicker and more consistent results

3. **Caching Layer**: Implement a distributed caching system like Amazon ElastiCache or Redis to store frequently accessed data and reduce API calls to the BC Law and LLM services

4. **Frontend Hosting**: Use cloud-based static website hosting services (e.g., Amazon S3 with CloudFront or Google Cloud Storage with Cloud CDN)

5. **API Gateway**: Implement an API Gateway to manage and secure the APIs between components and the BC Law API

6. **SSL Certificate Management**: Utilize cloud-based certificate management services like AWS Certificate Manager for secure, automated certificate creation and renewal

7. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement cloud-native monitoring and logging solutions for better observability and troubleshooting

8. **Security**: Utilize cloud security services (e.g., Amazon IAM, Secrets Manager) to ensure data protection and compliance with BC's data regulations

9. **Infrastructure as Code**:  Use Terraform to provision and manage cloud resources, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments across environments
