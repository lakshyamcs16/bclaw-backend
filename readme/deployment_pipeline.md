# Deployment pipeline

1. Source Control
   - Developers push code to GitHub repositories (separate for frontend and backend)
   - Feature branches are created for new developments

2. Continuous Integration
   - Triggered by push events or pull requests
   - Automated unit run for both frontend and backend
   - Code quality checks (linting, static analysis and repository based checks) performed
   - Build artifacts created (Docker images for backend, static files for frontend)

3. Automated Testing
   - Integration tests run in a staging environment
   - Performance tests check for regressions

4. Deployment to Staging
   - Automated deployment to a staging environment with tags and automated versioning
   - Smoke tests verify basic functionality
   - Manual QA and stakeholder review

5. Production Deployment
   - Approval gate for production deployment
   - Blue-green or canary deployment strategy implemented
   - Gradual rollout with monitoring for errors

6. Post-Deployment
   - Automated health checks and monitoring
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Rollback procedure in place for critical issues

7. Continuous Monitoring
   - Real-time monitoring of application health and performance
   - Alerts set up for critical issues
   - Regular review of logs and metrics for optimization
